2. Select "Add to .git/info/exclude".

### Toggle Problems Visibility

Quickly toggle the visibility of the Problems panel with a keyboard shortcut.

## Ideas

1. Automatic [grepWin](https://tools.stefankueng.com/grepWin.html) integration.
2. Integrate the docs of https://ss64.com/ somehow.
3. Securely [manage Jupyter kernels.](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/wiki/Loading-Kernels-from-insecure-directories)
4. Manage [Jupyter widget sources.](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/wiki/IPyWidget-Support-in-VS-Code-Python)
